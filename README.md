# Body-Language-Detection-with-MediaPipe-and-OpenCV
**This Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebook) provides the code and instructions for implementing body language detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV. This innovative tool incorporates two distinct models to achieve its functionality, providing users with a comprehensive approach to body language analysis.**
### 1. Scikit-Learn (.pkl)
##3 2. TensorFlow-Keras (.tflite)

The first model is built using **Scikit-Learn** and is stored in a **.pkl (Python Pickle) format**. This model enables quick and efficient body language detection, utilizing the capabilities of Scikit-Learn's machine learning algorithms.

The second model harnesses the power of **TensorFlow-Keras** and is deployed in a **TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) format**. TensorFlow-Keras is renowned for its deep learning capabilities, and the TensorFlow Lite format ensures that this model can be seamlessly integrated into various applications while maintaining low latency and optimal performance.
